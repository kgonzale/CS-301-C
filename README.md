# Lab1

Problem. Design software to find the cycle length of a linear congruential number generator. 
	
	For a positive integer n, an easy way generate random numbers 
	mod n is to use rand() % n, where rand() is C's random number 
	generator. How uniform are these values? Generate a large number 
	L of values. Count the number of times each value occurs and 
	determine how uniform the counts are.
